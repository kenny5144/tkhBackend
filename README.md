# Express Server

This repository contains a basic Express server written in Node.js. The server serves a single HTML file and listens on port 3000.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js installed on your machine.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/express-server.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

    ```bash
    cd express-server
    ```

3. **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## Running the Server

To start the server, run the following command:

```bash
node server.js
```

The server will be live and listening on port 3000.

## Accessing the Application

Open your web browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). You should see the served HTML file.

## Customization

- You can customize the HTML content by editing the `index.html` file.
- Modify the port number in `server.js` if you want the server to listen on a different port.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues, ensure that Node.js is installed and the dependencies are correctly installed using `npm install`.
